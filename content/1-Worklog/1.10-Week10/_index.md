### Week 10 Objectives:
- Finalize and complete the group project proposal by authoring the remaining "Expected Outcomes" and "Executive Summary" sections.

- Conduct a final proofread of the proposal to ensure quality and correct any minor errors.

- Begin the next course in the NLP specialization, "Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models," and establish a strong learning momentum.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:

### Week 10 Achievements:
- Project Proposal Finalized: Successfully completed the entire project proposal, including the "Executive Summary" and "Expected Outcomes," and performed a final proofread.

- Completed "Sequence Models" Course: Demonstrated exceptional learning velocity by finishing the "Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models" course in one week.

- Started "Attention Models" Course: Immediately began the next course, "Natural Language Processing with Attention Models," and made significant progress, covering Seq2seq, Attention, QKV, and completing two labs (Basic Attention and Scaled Dot-Product Attention).
